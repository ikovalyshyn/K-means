### Expriment 1

Generate two linearly separable clouds of points. Then apply K-means. Accuracy: 100%.

### Expriment 2

Generate two not linearly separable clouds of points. Then apply K-means. Accuracy: 94%.

### Expriment 3

Generate two clouds of points: cloud of points surrounded by a circle. Then apply K-means. Accuracy: 32%.


### Expriment 3.1

Apply Kernel K-means on the data generated in Experiment 3. Accuracy: 100%.
